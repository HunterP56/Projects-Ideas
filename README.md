# Current Projects and Ideas:


**Web Scraping bot, twitter, instagram, reddit, tiktok. (Current) (Main project)**
> Web Scraping all of these social media platforms, to then create multiple bots running different accounts, using the BeatifulSoup and SQL to output the data in a more readable format. All while using the data collected to improve on the social media bots themselves.
